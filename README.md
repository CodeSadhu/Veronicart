# Veronicart
Veronicart is a Django-based web-app that was created as a miniproject for my Academic term. It is a web-app I created with my friend [Onkar](https://github.com/TheGeekyMan) for fun and to understand how ecommerce websites function.

##### Check the project live [here](https://blooming-lake-82895.herokuapp.com/)

##### Stuff used:
  - Bootstrap Framework (Frontend)
  - Python/Django, Javascript (Backend handling)
  - SQLite Database (Built-in with Django)
  - A pinch of nerd magic

## For devs and other curious folk:
1. Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the latest version of Django: `pip install django`
3. Clone this project using `git clone` command
4. Open a terminal/CMD and navigate to `Veronicart/home` and run the command `python manage.py runserver`
5. Goto the link in the output shown in the cmd

##### Fun fact: The name Veronicart is a lame name derived after the cool AI - Veronica, created by Tony Stark (Iron Man) in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Veronica was created to control Hulk in case he lost it (we know how that worked out lol).
